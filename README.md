# CNN-on-MNIST-dataset
Here we try to use Convolutional Neural networks to make accurate predictions for hand written dataset

## Dependencies
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Tensorflow (keras is included in Tensorflow)
4. Matplotlib

## How to use:

Download Hand]written digit's dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/3004/download-all
Change the address to train and test data in line 7,8 in **final-code.py**.
Run the file using **python 3**(this code won't run in Python 2)

## Score on Kaggle

i'll udate this section soon
